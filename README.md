### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi! Iâ€™m Patrick. Iâ€™m a curiosity-driven data scientist with a background in machine learning, neuroscience and healthcare. Iâ€™m passionate about combining data with curiosity to make healthcare better for everyone. 

A few of my interests ðŸŒ± 
* <b>Applied AI in Healthcare </b>- how can data practitioners best collaborate with healthcare professionals to improve patient outcomes?
* <b>Data Interoperability </b>- how can we make various health data play well together?
* <b>Algorithmic Fairness </b>- how can we ensure data-driven solutions provide all patients with optimal and equitable care?

I also enjoy supporting aspiring analytics professionals with their career goals. Feel free to reach out ðŸ™‚
